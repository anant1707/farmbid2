# REAL TIME HANDWRITING RECOGNITION<br><br>
# INTRODUCTION:<br>
Generally, people find writing on paper easier than typing on a computer
but the more required or accepted format is digital.
To bridge this gap we propose to build an application which will convert
handwriting into formal text in real time and allow sharing or transferring
that text to other applications.

# PROPOSED SOLUTION /FEATURES :<br>
● We propose to make a desktop application which will have the
features of a canvas and provide a drawing area where we will be
having several features such as choosing pen thickness,colour,
eraser and other tools.<br>
● On the basis of content available on the canvas our application will
recognise handwritten text and convert into formal text.<br>
● We further propose to extend it to recognising symbols, equations,
diagrams etc.<br>
● It will support canvas sharing amongst users making it useful during
collaborative work.<br>
● We also propose to have OCR feature where we can convert an
already handwritten document to digital version.<br>
# TECHNICAL DETAILS :<br>
● For making the desktop application we propose to use ElectronJS
framework for development<br>
● For allowing the sharing of board we propose to use socket
programming and javascript.<br>
● For detecting and recognizing words and letters we shall use Deep
Learning (RNNs and LSTMs)<br>
